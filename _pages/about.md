I am a post-doc at the [LCA2 lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lca2/) of [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) [IC](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/). I defended my PhD thesis in Oct'21 at [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.kom.tu-darmstadt.de/kom-multimedia-communications-lab/). Previously, I obtained my bachelor's and master's degree from [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in). I am broadly interested in analyzing network performance using tools from Probability theory.

I am a postdoc at the [LCA2 lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lca2/) of [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) [IC](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/). I obtained my PhD from the [Technical University of Darmstadt](https://www.kom.tu-darmstadt.de/en/) in Oct'21. Before that, I did my master's and bachelor's at the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in). I am broadly interested in analyzing network performance using tools from probability theory.

Here is a copy of my [CV.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tYwgMHF3EZRfih-gFVSb1gFju4dLy57N/view?usp=share_link)
